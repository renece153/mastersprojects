# mastersprojects
A repository of projects and codes made while taking my master's degree

You can see the requirement for each exercise in the document provided: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14g39-4UP2RKIICQJPgbFXvfyTayPblsi/view?usp=sharing

Note: I do not own any of those exercises and they belong to UPOU. I only copied the guidelines for each exercise and the requirements. Please bear in mind that the purpose of showing the guidelines is to show a future employer of the programming skills I have and nothing more.
